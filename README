NAME
    DBD::SQLeet - SQLite3 DBI driver with optional encryption
    DBD::SQLeet is a combination of the
    DBD::SQLite CPAN module <https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite> and
    sqleet - public domain encryption extension for SQLite3.
    See <https://github.com/resilar/sqleet> for details.

    DBD::SQLeet Perl code and test suite
    are entirely based on the DBD::SQLite v.1.58 CPAN module.

    The DBD::SQLeet API is a verbatim copy of the DBD::SQLite v.1.58 API.
    See <https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite> for reference.

SYNOPSIS
      use DBI;
      my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLeet:dbname=$dbfile","","");
      $dbh->do("PRAGMA key = 'password';");

DESCRIPTION
    DBD::SQLeet is a complete SQLite3 DBI Driver with optional encryption.

    SQLite is a public domain file-based relational database engine that you
    can find at <http://www.sqlite.org/>.

    The DBD::SQLeet API is a verbatim copy of the DBD::SQLite v.1.58 API.
    See <https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::SQLite> for reference.

SQLITE VERSION
    DBD::SQLeet is compiled with a bundled sqleet library:
    sqleet version 0.24.0 as of this release.

    DBD::SQLeet follows the sqleet versioning scheme.
    <https://github.com/resilar/sqleet#versioning-scheme>

    Version 0.24.0 of sqleet is based on SQLite v3.24.0

DIFFERENCES FROM DBD::SQLite
    DBD::SQLeet may not open successfully a database using the following code:

      my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLite:file:$dbfile","","");

    SQLite3 support for opening an URI filename is otherwise not impaired.
    You can use:

      my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:SQLite:uri=file:$dbfile","","");
